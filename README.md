## Usage

First, create a .env file in the root of your directory and set your DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD to the database name (ecommerce_db) and your mysql username and password respectively. In the db folder, run mysql and type `source schema.sql;` to create your e-commerce database. Then, in the root directory, seed your database using `npm run seed`. Now you can run the server using `npm run start`. If you have Insomnia, you can run the various API routes to perform the CRUD operations on the Category, Tag, and Product tables.
